# valaxy-admin

Admin for blogs using [Valaxy](https://github.com/YunYouJun/valaxy)

Just code for UI, the code in this repo can't run directly.

If you wanna run these code, give apis which are declared in `global.d.ts`, and it will import `api(/index.xxx)` under its parent directory automatically.

Two versions are using:
  - [valaxy-admin-web](https://github.com/Rotten-LKZ/valaxy-admin-web)
  - [valaxy-admin-desktop](https://github.com/Rotten-LKZ/valaxy-admin-desktop)
